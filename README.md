# Real-Time CNN Fire Detection 
This Capstone Project serves as a chance to build intuitive front-end user interfaces for powerful back-end logic. 

The Application is designed to process live video and detect fire. Using TensorFlow/Keras, a CNN model is built and trained on scrapped datasets with the resultant model being used to provide lightweight, on the fly fire detection.
