# Real-Time CNN Fire Detection 

This capstone project was designed to explore the potential application of Machine Learning and Neural Networks to problem sets. 

## MVP
Create an application that can: 

* Stream video from a camera source,
* Process and prepare raw video/images for ML classification processing,
* Experiment for pixel mapping for fire dection,
* Experiment with pure ML classifcation for fire detection, 
* Raise an audible alarm and visual alarm when a fire is detected,
* Highlist suspected fire on a live video stream.





Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks, OpenCV, Google Colab.
